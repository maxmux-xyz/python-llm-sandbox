# Python LLM Sandbox

A personal sandbox for testing and experimenting with Language Models and NLP tasks. Contains various Jupyter notebooks and scripts for playing around with:

- Text classification
- Entity extraction
- Text summarization
- LangChain experiments
- Other LLM-related stuff

Nothing fancy, just a place to test things out! ðŸ§ªâœ¨
