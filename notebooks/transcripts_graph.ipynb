intentionally\\nfouled and had missed free throws so I I\\nthink someone said the Yahoo uh game\\npredictor had it at like 98% Texas Tech\\nwith like very little time left on the\\nclock and they somehow eaked it out now\\nthe the bullish people will say \"Oh you\\nlive through something like that now you\\nhave confidence to deal with anything.\"\\nBut you know the odds makers have put\\nDuke in front of Florida at this point\\nand that started in the opposite place\\nso anyway one game at a time super\\nexciting i I was out in San Francisco at\\nthe Chase Center got to hang out with\\nthe coach a bit and some of the players\\nparents and and it it was a good good\\ntrip and now since I\\'m in Austin it\\'s\\nright down the street here to San\\nAntonio so a lot of friends coming in\\nand we\\'ll we\\'ll see what happens it\\'s\\ngoing to be a heck of a weekend and uh\\nmaybe if a certain couple teams end up\\nin the in the championship game I\\'ll\\nsneak in there on Monday night i guess\\nas long as we\\'re repping and and rolling\\num you know I have two degrees one from\\nFlorida and one from Texas the Texas\\nladies are playing in the Final Four in\\nTampa so a lot of good stuff happening\\nspeaking a lot of good stuff happening I\\nthink there are some people in the world\\nthat think a lot of uh not so great\\nstuff is happening based upon market\\nreaction to the president\\'s\\nannouncements of these tariffs so why\\ndon\\'t we kick it off talking about\\nLiberation Day yeah so we\\'re recording\\nthis right after Trump\\'s presentation i\\nthink you and I both watched it and then\\nwe jumped on the pod um you\\'ve been\\ntalking about this like he it\\'s\\nobviously been choreographed that this\\nwas coming and you know you\\'ve been\\nsaying for a very long time that Trump\\nand his team are very serious about this\\nrather than the argument that oh it\\'s\\njust a means to an end you know and a\\nand a way to get a negotiation started\\nyou have made the point that you believe\\nthat they believe this is actually where\\nwe need to take the economy um and as as\\nsuch you\\'ve been conservative and\\nworried about where this would go you\\ngave a presentation last week on how to\\nthink about this what did you talk about\\nthere i think it was at the JP Morgan\\nTech conference it was pretty clear to\\nme and you we were talking about it in\\nearly Feb you know this was doctrinal\\nthis is you know there was a\\nphilosophical belief around trade that\\nthey wanted to you know create a more\\nfair and level playing field and the\\nreal debate uh you know has been going\\non is like how big and there are a\\ncouple different camps and so JP Morgan\\nhad this great event in Montana last\\nweek 100 tech CEOs but you know they had\\nHoward Lutnik Elon Saxs Doug Burger all\\ntalking about um you know various\\naspects of this and they asked me to do\\na little bit of a presentation on\\ndecoding the Trump economic agenda and\\nreally it boils down to this bill you\\nknow at the top I think that all the\\nCEOs in the room are pretty excited\\nabout the golden age that people have\\nbeen talking about you know a prog\\ngrowth administration pro business pro\\ninvestment lower taxes less regulation\\npro M&A we\\'ve seen this M&A flywheel\\nstarting to kick up this AI super cycle\\nbut everybody\\'s been pretty terrified\\nabout these tariffs and the real\\nquestion going into today Liberation Day\\nwas were tariffs going to land closer to\\nthe $600 billion trillion dollar tariff\\nlevel that Peter Navaro had been talking\\nabout and Howard Lutnik had been talking\\nabout or maybe at a little bit lower end\\nof the spectrum which we heard a little\\nbit more from from Scott Bessant and\\nKevin Hasset and I think everybody was\\nholding their breath well we got the\\nanswer we got the answer today and so I\\nwas framing that uh you know at the JP\\nMorgan conference i showed this slide\\nyou\\'ll get a kick out of you know I\\nended the I ended the uh presentation\\nyou know with two planes coming in for\\nlanding they both actually land believe\\nit or not but it\\'s like the glide path\\nthat we land here with tariffs and\\nbudget cuts matter a lot and so you know\\nwe got the news tonight you\\'re you\\'re\\nright we just we just listened to the\\npresident talk you know and he came in\\non the larger end of this i mean there\\'s\\nno other way to slice it there was a\\nthere was a headline that hit right\\nafter the market closed from the Wall\\nStreet Journal I believe that it was 10%\\nacross the board and the markets jumped\\nup like 2 and a.5%\\nright and then as the presentation\\nstarted unfolding they started coming in\\npeople saw this chart that they\\npresented on reciprocal tariffs right\\nwhere they say tariffs on China going to\\n54% can you believe that 34% on top of\\nthe 20% that already exists and he\\nstarts going through this list and the\\nfutures the S&P futures the Q the NASDAQ\\nfutures start sinking they had a 600\\nbasis point fall between where they\\ninitially jumped and where they ended up\\nso the market is not liking this at all\\nand depending what index you were\\nlooking at we were already down you know\\n8 to 15% on the year now whatever comes\\nin tomorrow will be on top of that so\\nthat\\'s the chart that\\'s kind of the\\ninitial reaction out of the market we\\ncan we can break them down a little bit\\nif you want um but that was the initial\\nreaction right and one of the pieces\\nthat I you know witnessed and I think\\neverybody else did as well and maybe you\\nhave more data on it is when they said\\nreciprocal tariff they kind of redefined\\nwhat a tariff is for the reciprocal\\ncalculation and they are including other\\nwhatever I don\\'t know what else goes in\\nthere maybe you know exactly what what\\nfills this in but but basically the\\nTrump administration is calculating an\\neffective tariff if you will for each\\nand every other country which may not be\\nthe explicit tariff correct i mean they\\ncall them non-tariff trade barriers this\\nis everything from what they call\\ncurrency manipulation to things like uh\\njudicial actions that restrict free and\\nfair trade of our products into their\\ncountries and by the way we know there\\nare non-tariff trade barriers so like\\nit\\'s it it\\'s not totally surprising but\\nif if you and I were to do the math on\\nthese you can kind of make those numbers\\nwhatever you want to make them and so\\nyou know if I had to go through this the\\ntariffs largely break down into let\\'s\\ncall it three or four big buckets right\\nthere\\'s the auto tariffs that\\'s largely\\non Mexico Canada and Germany and the\\nauto tariffs were imposed at 25% this\\nyou know in fact he had 20 members of\\nthe UAW worth Union in the front row at\\nthe event he invited uh I think the\\npresident of the UAW up on stage to make\\nsome comments and he said \"These people\\nused to be Democrats they\\'re Republicans\\nnow we\\'re the only ones who fight for\\nhim.\" And by the way this is really you\\nknow he said \"We won the state of\\nMichigan because of this this is what I\\ncampaigned on you know these are the\\npromises we made and we\\'re delivering on\\nthe promises.\" It is striking to me that\\njust politically this is what Democrats\\nwere running on 20 years ago and it just\\nshows how much the political parties\\nhave changed so so this is a big uh you\\nknow tariff differential as it relates\\nto autos then he had the reciprocal\\ntariffs which are the ones that I\\noutlined here bill remember Trump is the\\nnegotiator chief this is the starting\\npoint all these tariffs go into place\\nwe\\'ll put these charts up on April 9th\\ncountry by country and so we\\'re going to\\nhear all these ad hoc negotiations going\\non some of which I\\'m sure like Vietnam\\nhe\\'ll declare victory on even before we\\nget to April 9th because they\\'ve already\\ncapitulated on a bunch of tariffs he\\'s\\nalso declared that there are $6 trillion\\nof new investments right that people\\nhave committed to in the United States\\nhe mentioned Nvidia Apple TSMC Soft Bank\\nOpen AI in his remarks in fact I I I\\nparticularly noted when he talked about\\nSoftBank and OpenAI he said great\\ncompanies um so you know for the people\\nwho are you know watching the the battle\\nbetween OpenAI and and X that was\\nnotable and then he said we\\'re going to\\nhave a minimum tariff of 10% on all\\ncountries so even if you\\'re not on this\\nlist we\\'re going to have a minimum\\ntariff of 10% on all countries and then\\nof course China is kind of in this\\nbucket on its own right that\\'s going to\\nbe a huge negotiation on its own there\\nare a lot of things that go into that\\nnegotiation everything from um you know\\nthe Panama Canal to the Tik Tok stuff so\\nset that aside if you will for a second\\nthere\\'s no no way that lands I think at\\n54% that\\'s the headline tariffs okay\\nwhen we do the math and we add all of\\nthese up and you know say what is what\\nwhat does this come up with okay the\\nheadline is we were at 77 billion last\\nyear and we end up at about 750 billion\\nright remember Peter Navaro the hawk the\\nperson who had been saying we\\'re going\\nto land big tariffs he was estimating\\n600 billion so this definitely landed on\\nthe larger side but then they came out\\nright after that and there was a\\nfootnote about things that were exempted\\nfrom the tariffs exemptions exemptions\\nwhich included pharmaceuticals and\\nnotably for you and I semiconductors wow\\nright so Taiwan\\'s got a 32% tariff but\\nsemiconductors are exempted and so we\\'re\\ngoing through the value of those\\nexemptions right now my hunch is that\\nthis is going to land right around 600\\nbillion but Bill I have to ask you you\\nknow here we are you and I we\\'re we\\'re\\nwe\\'re trying to make our way through\\nthis make sense out of it i don\\'t think\\nthere are many CEOs we know who support\\nthis or like this in fact I think a lot\\nof congressional Republicans don\\'t like\\nthis you\\'ve made an eloquent defense of\\nyou know the benefits of free and and\\nand and largely fair trade when you\\nstart hearing things like this like okay\\nthis category got exemption you know or\\nthis category got exempted like just\\ngive me your reaction right as somebody\\nwho who I think totally understands the\\nthe the benefits of free trade when you\\nsee the Republican party doing this you\\nknow how do you how does it make you\\nfeel well yeah I look I mean at at at a\\nhigh level I\\'m a believer in open\\nmarkets free trade and comparative\\nadvantage and\\num that\\'s been studied for a very long\\ntime um there are very solid\\nmathematical arguments why if you pull\\nup the trade walls between multiple\\ncountries that you\\'re going to hurt the\\nefficiency of both of them um in the\\nlong run and I you know at least from a\\ntheoretical perspective I\\'m a believer\\nin that um I think there\\'s another issue\\nfor the markets and for the CEOs um\\nwhich has to do with the both the the\\nslow pace at which they could\\nrealistically respond to this and then\\nthe amount of ambiguity that\\'s been out\\nthere and so let\\'s say what what the\\nadministration wants to encourage is for\\nyou to relocate a factory that you have\\nor\\nproduction that you have in Thailand you\\nknow and put it on the American shores\\nthat\\'s not a quick process and if you\\nstart that process today it might take\\nthree years you know before you\\'d have\\nthe type of volume that\\'d be capable of\\nbringing that back and probably at a\\nhigher cost i mean one of the one of the\\nthings that I\\'ve said over and over\\nagain I don\\'t think our labor is\\nglobally competitive nor do I think it\\nwants to be and so even bringing it back\\nyou\\'re going to have a higher cost of\\nproduction because we\\'re going to have a\\nhigher cost of labor that being said you\\nknow this ambiguity you know there\\'s a\\nlot of people even going right into this\\nuh announcement that didn\\'t know what\\npercentage of it was real versus bluster\\nand there\\'s I think at this point just\\nreading the papers not making my own\\nassessment the administration has a\\nreputation of maybe some of this is for\\nnegotiation maybe some of it\\'s not real\\nand so you\\'re left not knowing what\\nwhat\\'s going to be the policy 3 months\\nfrom now 6 months from now 12 months\\nfrom now which makes it very hard to\\nallocate capex in any meaningful way\\nwhatsoever i I I think so well stated um\\nyou and I have said you know markets and\\nbusiness abhores uncertainty right it\\ncan deal with almost anything but it has\\nto have predictability so it can build a\\nforecast so it can look at a uh an\\ninvestment and say is that MPV positive\\nand I was literally texting with some\\nbig CEOs during the president\\'s\\nannouncement and they are asking\\nquestions do you see us exempted you\\nknow are we in there and this is just\\namazing to me right that you have this\\nlevel of uncertainty you know I was with\\nthose 100 CEOs in Montana last week and\\nI would say almost to a one they said\\nthings are slowing down in February and\\nMarch because nobody knows what to do\\nand remember you know the Fed had just\\ncome out last week had taken down their\\nforecast for GDP growth had taken up\\ntheir forecast for inflation had taken\\nup their forecast for uh unemployment by\\nthe end of the year so the economy you\\nknow most major economists um are\\nincreasing their probability of a\\nrecession are slowing the rate of growth\\nand the question today was was\\nliberation day a clearing event does\\neverybody have clarity now and I think\\nyour point you make is a great one even\\nthough they may have gotten an exemption\\nor they may not have an exemption the\\nquestion is can I count on this and how\\nlong can I count on this and can I\\nreally plan a year out based upon this\\nor is this going to change yet again\\nover the course of the year and so and\\nby the way there\\'s there\\'s cascading\\neffects so if if you\\'re unsure about\\nthings like this you\\'re not going to\\nhire a bunch of people for example\\nyou\\'re probably going to pause hiring\\nbecause you don\\'t know you know you\\ndon\\'t know how how much earnings you\\'re\\ngoing to have so those kind of things\\ncan proliferate downward and affect\\nunemployment and and eventually affect\\nconsumer spending just by freezing you\\nknow nearly everything in the uh in the\\neconomy let me tell you two other\\ncascading effects i heard from one of\\nthe CEOs last week that four contracts\\nwith them had actually been cancelled\\nright because they had like three\\nEuropean contracts canled and one Asian\\ncontract cancelled because the countries\\nwere so upset with America uh you know\\nthat they\\'re going to do deals instead\\nwith uh European country companies or or\\nwhatever the case may be you know and\\nthen I saw a couple tweets Bill one was\\nthat you know China and Korea and Japan\\nwere actually going to collaborate in a\\nresponse to the US tariffs and somebody\\nsaid you know we haven\\'t seen the\\nKoreans and the Japanese and the Chinese\\ncombined forces on anything since the\\nMongols caused them to you know to get\\ntogether and so it is causing a lot of\\nstrange bed fellas and I sent you the\\ntweet where the Europeans the president\\nof Europe the president Mcron they\\'re\\nall going to China and they want to talk\\nabout closer trade negotiate or\\nrelationships with China and you warned\\nus about this I think it said the\\nmeeting was v in Vietnam and obviously I\\nI got that from the president the\\neconomist who had predicted that that\\nwould happen but yes you know there\\'s no\\nreason that that wouldn\\'t happen and\\nthere\\'s a lot of a lot of ramifications\\nof this i I don\\'t think that anything\\ncame out of it that\\'s going to be good\\nfor the markets and good for good you\\nknow good for stocks but that\\'s more\\nyour world than mine i\\'ve always shunned\\nmacro analysis let me just maybe opine\\non that for a second like where do I\\nthink we go from here after hours with\\nthe NASDAQ down peak to trough post\\nTrump at almost 18% right that\\'s down a\\nlot a lot of names in the NASDAQ are\\ndown 40 or 50% so we\\'re starting to get\\nsome of that fear into the market\\nsomebody asked and I said at the very\\nroot I do believe the president wants to\\ndo deals he believes in fairer trade i\\nthink we\\'re going to land the plane here\\ncloser to three or 400 billion in\\ntariffs not 6 or 700 and certainly not a\\ntrillion in tariffs um even though it\\nfeels today like it was bigger than that\\nand one of the things I think that\\'s\\ngoing to kind of force the president\\'s\\nhand he talked at the press conference\\nhe had a bunch of senators there and\\nhouse members the senators and house\\nmembers are hearing from their\\nconstituent CEOs that they don\\'t like\\nthese tariffs and remember most\\nimportant to the president he wants to\\nget this reconciliation package passed\\nwhich he calls a big beautiful bill he\\nwants to get this thing passed which\\nputs in place no taxes on tips and the\\npermanency of the tax cuts which he\\npassed in his first administration he\\ncan\\'t afford to lose a single Republican\\nvote and so I think that that also is\\ngoing to guide him a little bit more to\\nthe center and that\\'s what you know\\nwe\\'ll see what the whether whether the\\nmarket believes that certainly didn\\'t\\nbelieve it after hours today we\\'re going\\nto get a little bit more positive on the\\ncompanies we like the best cuz we think\\nsome of this fear is now getting priced\\nin what What will you be looking for in\\nthe next 30 to 60 days as this plays out\\nyeah I think I I think we\\'re still in\\nthe fog of war certainly but I will be\\nlooking at you know do these exemptions\\non things like semiconductors and\\npharmaceuticals hold are we seeing the\\nthe country bycountry renegotiation on\\nsome of these things and probably most\\nimportantly Bill it\\'s really about China\\nchina is the second you know largest\\neconomic you know power on you know in\\nthe world it scares me how big the\\ntariffs are that we are suggesting are\\ngoing to go in place on China um and I\\nthink you know it\\'s imminent that he and\\nshe are going to have to talk and get a\\nbig trade deal done and so those are the\\nthings I\\'m going to be watching for i\\ndon\\'t think I see any clearing event\\nhere um for at least uh another 30 to 60\\ndays but remember the best opportunities\\nto buy something are when people are a\\nlittle fearful so you may have to just\\nyou know uh take a bit of a leap of\\nfaith on this one if you want to be if\\nyou want to purchase at the best prices\\nmakes sense you know another thing that\\nwe heard a lot about this week Bill\\nspeaking of China is you know some\\ndevelopments in Chinese open source and\\nsome developments on the US open source\\nfront particularly with respect to these\\nfrontier models you have a lot of I\\nthink understanding about kind of the\\nhistory in China around open source as\\nwell as around the history in the United\\nStates around open source so help us\\nunpack if you will what do you think\\nstrategically is going on in China with\\nrespect to these open- source models\\ni\\'ve seen some people tweet that maybe\\nthat you know deepseek was forced into\\nopen source by by she do you think\\nthat\\'s going on or or is there something\\nelse going on here and by the way I mean\\nall this culminated in the past week\\nwith open AI moving you know are talking\\nagain about open weighted models which\\nis a a I think a really important data\\npoint so how did how do we get from\\nwhere we were to where we are so yeah I\\nread that same tweet and I think it was\\nremarkably misplaced china has been\\nsupportive of open source for well over\\na decade now if you look on most of the\\nmajor open source product uh products\\nand look at the management page and who\\nthe sponsors are for these like Linux\\nyou know that you\\'ll see many of the\\nmajor Chinese companies have been there\\nand been supporting it for a while why\\nuh they\\'ve been accused of stealing tech\\nIP for years and so when something like\\nopen source comes along this looks like\\nthe best thing possible right there\\'s no\\none that can accuse us of IP theft\\nbecause there is no IP ownership in an\\nopen- source world and so having dealt\\nwith those accusations for probably 40\\nor 50 years I think everyone in China\\nyou know the government and the\\nentrepreneurs at large view open source\\nas is a very positive movement for their\\ncountry relative um to the west and so\\nthey\\'ve been they\\'ve been in on it for a\\nlong time um they\\'re very adept at it\\nthey\\'re very um they\\'re very big\\nbelievers in it you know when we talked\\nabout the interview with the Deep Seek\\nfounder I would say he had as much kind\\nof\\nemotional like his his entire emotional\\nmindset was tied to open source like he\\nbelieves in it and wants to support it\\nso that\\'s I think that\\'s an important\\nbackdrop so I don\\'t think China got\\nthere um in some calculated way or do I\\nthink it was some recent move i think\\nthey embraced open source you know over\\na decade ago because it made a ton of\\nsense for them in a world that had had\\npointed a finger at them from an IP\\nstandpoint so so so let me just double\\nclick on that so basically what you\\'re\\nsaying is they may have been fearful\\nthat they would have been cut off from\\nother type of software products in the\\nUnited States like you know there might\\nhave been export controls or other\\nthings put on them so they said I may as\\nwell support Linux because I may not be\\nable to get Windows right but I think\\nthat that discussion happened a long\\ntime ago like like like it wasn\\'t recent\\nbut I think it\\'s important because that\\nlays the foundation right that if that\\'s\\na foundational belief among Chinese\\nentrepreneurs and Chinese companies then\\nit\\'s understandable that this new\\ngeneration of entrepreneurs might also\\nsee the advantages of open source\\nanother another thing that I think\\npeople have to remember is that within\\nalso within the past decade and and\\nmaybe 15 years many US companies have\\nlearned to use open-source as a\\ndefensive tool rather than just an\\noffensive tool and this is say more yeah\\nso this is the biggest companies out\\nthere if they get in a position where\\nthey feel like they\\'re behind the\\neightball so they\\'re not in a leadership\\nposition they will embrace open source\\nas an attempt to level the playing field\\nand a great example is Kubernetes so\\nAmazon took this huge lead with AWS\\num in the hosted server business\\neveryone was afraid of that google had a\\npiece of technology called Kubernetes it\\nwas orchestration that would allow you\\nto move a workload if that became a\\nstandard from one you know one large\\nserver vendor to another right it\\nbasically created um ease of\\ndistribution so you could run on\\nmultiple clouds they went to the Linux\\nFoundation they recruited IBM a whole\\nbunch of other people got everyone\\nbehind it and it it gained so much\\nmomentum that Amazon had to embrace\\nKubernetes so it worked and we don\\'t\\nhave a monopolist in that cloud business\\nright now you know perhaps because of\\nthat deaf move made by made by Google um\\nbut they did it with Android against\\nApple you know big not notable and Meta\\ndid it with Llama here right they they\\nthey came to the table they weren\\'t\\nfirst to the table in the AI space but\\nthey were disruptive with open source\\none one other thing I would I would\\npoint out about that type of move in\\nattention in addition to saying it\\'s\\ndefensive I think it\\'s great for\\nconsumers like if you study economics in\\nin in business school you know there\\'s\\nthis notion of pure competition like\\nwhere where do you have the most fluid\\ncompetition which leads to the lowest\\nprices for a consumer and certainly open\\nsource does that versus proprietary code\\nlike it\\'s just hyper competitive and\\nthat\\'s why it\\'s disruptive and that\\'s\\nwhy people use it in this way so that\\'s\\na huge backdrop to where we are today i\\nbelieve uh DeepS has been remarkably\\nsuccessful in the enterprise and that\\'s\\nyou know it\\'s hosted by AWS it\\'s hosted\\nby Google it\\'s being used around the\\nworld i\\'ve I\\'ve heard you know from\\nHugging Face that it\\'s been you know\\nforked over 1500 times on their site and\\nso it\\'s it\\'s prolific i\\'m beginning to\\nhear you know concerns that DC may take\\naction to limit the use of deepseek and\\nyou\\'re saying Washington may intervene\\nto take action because they\\'re you know\\nthere there are people perhaps lobbying\\nagainst or other concerns that\\nWashington may have about open- source\\nChinese models being used by American i\\nthink it\\'s safe to say both those things\\nare happening there\\'s people that are\\nreally concerned about uh you know China\\ntechnology getting underneath our\\nproducts whether or not this particular\\ncode could be bad or not they just might\\nhave that default and then I think there\\nare people that are lobbying because it\\nwould benefit their company either way\\nif that gets traction you have a window\\nin the US right now where someone might\\nmove to go left of deepseek in terms of\\nopenness on one of their models either\\nin an offensive or defensive move and I\\nthink it\\'s a short window and so it\\'ll\\nbe very interesting from my point of\\nview to see whether Google does that or\\nor Meta i think they have an\\nannouncement coming up in a few weeks of\\ntheir next model i don\\'t think\\nAnthropica would do it they\\'ve been so\\nanti-open source it would be very out of\\ncharacter for them um but it will you\\nknow will be interesting to see what\\nhappens on this front and that leads us\\nup to OpenAI making an announcement\\nwhich I\\'ll let you describe well yeah\\nyou know listen we\\'ve talked here and\\nSam has been dropping the breadcrumbs on\\nTwitter right that you know they wanted\\nto launch an open source model they\\'ve\\nbeen GPU constrained they\\'ve been\\nbandwidth constrained but he got the\\nannouncement out this week which I was\\nthrilled with where he said you know\\nwe\\'re excited to release a powerful new\\nopenweight language model with reasoning\\nin the coming months and we want to talk\\nto devs so here he\\'s inviting all these\\ndevelopers uh to participate and give\\nfeedback um he said we want to make it a\\nvery very good model we\\'re planning to\\nrelease an openw weight language model\\none of our first since GPT2 um and he\\nsays we\\'ve been thinking about this for\\na long time and the interesting thing is\\nsomebody you know in the replies I saw\\nsomebody said are you going to make\\npeople buy licenses if they get a a lot\\nof users like Meta is doing with Llama\\nand he kind of takes a jab at Meta and\\nhe says no we\\'re not going to say no yes\\nhe said no he says says no which which\\nindicates maybe we\\'re going to out open\\nyou know Llama so that\\'s that\\'s on the\\none hand you know kind of open AI on the\\nother and by the way just just hold your\\nthoughts so in case people don\\'t know\\nyou know the openness is a continuum\\nit\\'s not black or white and that\\'s true\\nof all the open source technologies in\\nthe open-source model world um some of\\nthe players most notably Meta with Llama\\nhave a usage\\nrestriction against the free use of the\\nmodel at 700 million and that\\'s what you\\nwere referring to and so at least in a\\ntweet uh Sam suggested they won\\'t have\\nthat in theirs so back to you yeah no\\nwhich I think is notable because\\nremember at the end of this month we\\nhave Llama Con which is the developer\\nevent for Llama um it\\'s a big deal for\\nMeta the the launch of Llama 4 has been\\nrumored for a long time and in fact I\\nthink there are just a lot of people who\\nare surprised they haven\\'t released it\\nbut it seems to everybody they\\'re going\\nto have to release it ahead of Llamicon\\nwhat I\\'m hearing Bill is that it\\'ll be a\\n400 billion parameter model it\\'ll use\\nlike it\\'ll be a mixture of expert model\\nusing you know 50 60 uh 70 experts it\\'s\\ngoing to have huge context window like\\n10 million context window you know and\\nit\\'s going to launch this month i think\\nit\\'s terrific that OpenAI has now fully\\ncommitted you know everybody on the team\\nBrockman Kevin etc were all retweeting\\nthis fully committed and maybe even\\nsuggesting that this is going to be a\\nmore capable model and even more open i\\nthink it\\'s good that we have competition\\nin the US for an open- source model and\\nwhen it comes to the administration and\\nwhat Washington DC is going to do my\\nbest sense is they do not want to see a\\nHuawei Deepseek Belt and Road either\\nwith chips or with open- source models\\nthey do not want to see the world run on\\ndeepseek on you know Huawei 910 chips\\nand so you know this gets back to the AI\\ndiffusion bill and how we\\'re going to\\nrestrict these things um I think they\\nwould love to see the world continue to\\nrun on you know US compute US silicon\\nand they would love to see Llama and and\\nperhaps OpenAI\\'s open source model\\naround the world they know it has a lot\\nof distribution so I think this was a\\nreally positive uh step forward on that\\nand you bring up an important point\\nwhich is you know you you don\\'t you\\ndon\\'t have to be let\\'s say something\\ndoes happen to limit DeepSk usage that\\nthe whoever is going to jump in to try\\nand lead the open source movement in the\\nwest that if they want to be a global\\nplayer they don\\'t just have to get left\\nof of everyone else in the west they\\nstill have to compete with deepseek on a\\nglobal on a global basis and I don\\'t\\nthink you know it\\'ll be interesting to\\nwatch i\\'m very very curious how this\\nplays out i\\'ve already asked them at\\nHugging Face if maybe he will create a\\ncontinuum so we can rank all these\\ndifferent models from an openness\\nperspective because there\\'s so many\\ndifferent facets by which you could be\\nopen or not oh but actually I had one\\nmore thing and this is since you\\'re\\ninvolved at OpenAI you can correct me if\\nI\\'m wrong but you have been you know\\nsaying for I would say a couple quarters\\nnow that the real opportunity for OpenAI\\nis on the product side versus the model\\nside which which hints at being more of\\na consumer product than say enter the\\nenterprise API business that they\\'ve\\nalso been And if if they think that also\\nand I I\\'m not involved so this is\\nconjecture on my part being more open\\nwith your model is is a really deaf move\\nbecause it will put more pressure on\\nother players um to try and keep up and\\nit will allow your model to have more\\npervasive usage globally and you talked\\nabout running out of compute you know\\nthe minute you put that model out where\\nother people can download it they\\'re\\ndoing that on their servers not on yours\\num and so I I just think it\\'s a very\\nclever move for the same reason Google\\nwould have supported Kubernetes you\\nyou\\'re you\\'re you\\'re kind of wiping out\\nthe business opportunity for other\\nmodels to play on the API side if you\\nmake yours open which is a helps protect\\nthe competitive flank and once again\\ngreat for consumers yeah I think it\\'s I\\nI think you know it makes sense on a\\nbunch of fronts on the first front um I\\nthink they want developers to develop on\\ntheir platform and build applications\\nfor you know for open AI and so this\\nbrings them into the ecosystem number\\ntwo I think that they fundamentally have\\na view that they want to build you know\\nthey want to build products and\\napplications that move humanity forward\\nwith AI and this is another way to do it\\nat scale um you know Sam has said uh\\npublicly now I\\'ve heard him several\\ntimes say that he thinks that models are\\ncommoditizing they\\'re anti into the game\\nyou know they will continue to push the\\nfrontier so he thinks they\\'ll have the\\nbest models but that general\\nintelligence you know that average level\\nintelligence is we already see is going\\nto be widely distributed and that the\\nbattleground bill is really going to be\\nfought around products and services and\\nI wouldn\\'t say that they view themselves\\nas an exclusively a consumer company but\\nclearly Chad GBT is a major thrust a\\nmajor focus of the business it\\'s the\\nmarket leading consumer uh application\\nprobably has 80 to 90% market share i\\nthink network effects are kicking in and\\nother things but I also think their\\nenterprise business is if not the\\nbiggest one of the biggest and also\\ngrowing at the fastest rate um because\\nremember the consumerization of the\\nenterprise one of the fascinating things\\nthat\\'s happening in the enterprise is\\nthese are all users of chat GPT so when\\nthe CEO shows up in the boardroom and\\nsomebody says \"Yeah we\\'re looking at\\nbringing AI into the company and they\\'re\\nwe\\'re looking at you know chat GPT\\nenterprise.\" It\\'s an easy yes it reminds\\nme of when every CEO said \"Hey get me an\\niPhone you know in the enterprise.\" And\\nthey were on Blackberry and they all\\nswitched to iPhones because they loved\\nusing them at home i think the natural\\nthing for them to do so it\\'s not to say\\nenterprise is going to be a bla b b b b\\nb b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b\\nb b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b it\\'s not\\ngoing to be w or take all but I think\\nthese guys do have their eyes squarely\\nset on building a probably there\\'s\\nprobably two different types of\\nenterprise there\\'s probably a product\\nthat people buy user licenses for for\\ndoing you know white collar uh research\\ntype work where they may where I think\\nwhat you said will be very relevant like\\nhaving the the UI they\\'re used to and\\nthen there\\'s the the separate side which\\nis models that underly the type you know\\ntypes of business processes that you\\'re\\nbuilding well one of the things you\\npinged me on this week was the\\ninvestment round around open AI and you\\nknow I\\'m happy to share what I can share\\nbut you know you what was announced yeah\\nwell I mean they announced the long\\nrumored investment that was led by\\nSoftBank um which many people described\\nin the headline as a $40 billion\\ninvestment round i think if you read the\\nbreakdown of it it\\'s you know it comes\\nin a couple tranches the first trunch\\nbeing closer to 10 billion the second\\ntrunch being closer to 30 billion and\\nit\\'s an extraordinary amount of money\\nit\\'s bigger than any I bigger than I\\nthink the largest IPO sons maybe one or\\ntwo that has ever been done i\\'ve often\\ndescribed these as private IPOs\\naltimeter participated along with\\nseveral others who were reported and the\\nvaluation was like 260 pre um which\\nwould make it if all the money were to\\ncome in a 300 post valuation and so it\\ncertainly got a lot of attention this\\nweek and you know you asked me the\\nquestion I think Bill just around kind\\nof valuation right how did we think\\nabout valuation the first thing I would\\nsay is market leaders never look cheap\\nwhen I invested in Google in 2005 when I\\ninvested in you know Meta when the IPO\\nbroke and we looked at those latest\\nstage private rounds i certainly\\nremember the Microsoft round in a meta\\nat 15 billion that was roundly\\ncriticized as being incredibly expensive\\nnone of these things you\\'re certainly\\nnot going to buy a market leader on the\\ncheap but if you really look at this I\\nthink that they\\'ve they\\'ve said publicly\\nthey expect their revenues this year to\\nbe around 13 billion right to to to do\\n13 billion in revenue probably means you\\nhave to exit the year closer to 15 to 18\\nbillion in run rate revenue so as I look\\nat this on a forward run run run rate\\nfor this year you\\'re paying something\\nlike you know 20 times revenue for the\\nbusiness okay now we also had a couple\\nother announcements you know this week\\nthere\\'s you know there\\'s the anthropic\\nfunding round and there\\'s talk that\\nthey\\'re doing a billion to two billion\\nin revenue a $60 billion funding round\\nso that to me looks like something like\\n50 times revenue so again you got OpenAI\\nat 20 times Anthropic at 50 times and\\nthen we had the merger of X and X.AI\\ncorrect which are rumored to have around\\nlet\\'s call it 3 billion in revenue and\\nthe combined market cap there is like\\n125 billion so that looks like closer to\\n80 times revenue so the market leader\\nhere which usually trades at a premium\\nnot at a discount to me you know again\\nwe can argue about the sustainability\\nand could somebody disrupt them and is\\n20 times a good valuation in this\\nenvironment and yeah but aren\\'t they\\nspending a lot of money on compute and\\nis is it really high value revenue um\\nbut apples for apples relative to their\\npeers um it certainly appears to me like\\nuh you know 20 versus 50 versus 80 it\\'s\\nhard to say that this would be more\\nexpensive on a multiple basis than\\nAnthropic or uh or or X.AI yeah and I\\nalso read that there there like are\\nstill contingencies on whether the full\\nconversion from a nonprofit to a\\nfor-profit happens so I think there\\'s\\nsome stuff if that\\'s true there\\'s still\\nsome stuff to play out but you know one\\nthing I would say when I witnessed this\\nfrom afar and and once again you\\'re\\nyou\\'re involved I\\'m not so correct me if\\nI\\'m wrong but you know having lived\\nthrough the the Uber lift situation\\nwhich oddly had Masa coming to the table\\nalso um you know our world has just\\nevolved into one where so many people\\nbelieve in power at all so many people\\nbelieve in network effects and that\\nthese markets or winner or take all that\\nyou end up with these massive capital\\nraising rounds and you know it\\'s not\\nlost on me that both with Stargate and\\nwith this one the headline numbers\\nbigger than you know the peace meal when\\nyou start to unpack it which you know\\nfor better for worse from my position\\nsmells of being promotional and you know\\nand and so why would you do that why are\\nyou why are you trying to have a bigger\\nheadline number and that number does get\\nrepeated in the press So it it does work\\nin that way and and I come back to you\\nknow I suspect the company\\'s sending a\\nmessage to Anthropic and anyone else in\\nthe game that that we\\'re here for the\\nlong haul and you know they probably\\ndidn\\'t anticipate all the moves that\\nElon\\'s made with X and Twitter and and\\nobviously that is is a another deep\\npocketed player but but boy you know if\\nyou\\'re if you\\'re on the anthropic you\\nknow investment you know side I I you\\nI\\'d be scared like like I you know and\\nI\\'ve I\\'ve lived through this before it\\nis a it is a uh a sport of kings if you\\nwill and then lastly one thing that\\nnaturally falls out of that is unit\\neconomics get postponed you have to\\nbelieve in the power law and the network\\neffect they they in addition to that\\nheadline number you know I think they\\'ve\\nsaid publicly they expect to lose you\\nknow five to seven billion this year and\\nyou know with an employee count of I\\nthink 6 to 7,000 that\\'s not going to run\\nyou more than a billion or two so\\nthere\\'s some number between the revenue\\nnumber you talked about and subtracting\\ntwo billion for expenses and the rest is\\nyour operating cost of keeping this AI\\nmachine going and you know I ran some\\nloose numbers and I come up around 15 or\\n20 bucks a year for a non-paid user you\\nknow just to to run the servers on their\\nbehalf and you know eventually you might\\nget to advertising eventually you may\\nconvert more of them to paid there these\\nare these are things we\\'ve seen play out\\nover time they played out with ad models\\nbut once again if you\\'re going to try\\nand lay chase to them um you got to be\\nprepared to underwrite that cost\\nyourself right you know it it listen I\\nthink the analogy is a fair one Bill and\\nobviously Masa was involved in the Uber\\nlift battle so it\\'s an easy one\\nparticularly with his involvement here\\nto say you\\'ve referred to it before as\\nweapons of economic destruction all of\\nthis capital um but I would remind you\\nthere was a moment in time in\\n2020 where the headlines were that Uber\\nwould never be profitable it was a\\nfailed business model it will never make\\nmoney and here\\'s a business that\\'s going\\nto do 6 billion in free cash flow this\\nyear no doubt right and so and so the\\nwinner does take all the winner does\\ntake most i will tell you as a\\nshareholder I speak with the leadership\\nof the company all the time about unit\\neconomics obviously if I\\'m investing in\\nthe business I feel confident in their\\nleadership around unit economics i\\'m you\\nknow one of the things that I think\\'s\\nreally important here is just like\\nwhat\\'s happening in the business right\\nsam tweeted this week uh they added a\\nmillion chat GBT users in an hour y in\\nan hour that they crossed 20 million\\nsubscribers paying subscribers for Chat\\nGBT they crossed 500 million weekly\\naverage users of Chat GPT in fact they\\nwere they\\'re they\\'re going so gang\\nbusters they\\'re throttling all their\\ndemand in fact I don\\'t know if you saw\\nDavid Sax\\'s tweet where he said\\n\"America\\'s leading AI companies are all\\nreporting that demand is off the charts\\nso much so that they\\'re being forced to\\nimpose rate limits and he said\\n\"Fortunately we have massive new\\ninfrastructure projects coming online.\"\\nWhich gets me to the point of why are\\nthey raising so much money right and you\\nand I are talking about taking the pod\\ndown to Abalene Texas to see Stargate to\\nDenton Texas um to see you know the\\nCororeweave facility that they\\'re\\nstanding up for open AI and the fact of\\nthe matter is I think that they need to\\nbring on a massive amount of compute\\njust to support the demand they\\ncurrently have i can tell you when you\\nlook at the product pipeline for open AI\\nright whether it\\'s uh you know there\\nthere two or three models they already\\nhave completed on the shelf there\\'s a\\nlot of agent uh stuff that they want to\\ndo that\\'s on the shelf i think there\\'s a\\nlot of stuff they want to do around\\npricing but they can\\'t do these things\\ntoday and open source with their current\\nlevel of GPU demand and you know Sam\\nwent on online said if anybody has a a\\ncluster of 100,000 GPUs you know send me\\na DM and you know you may say it\\'s\\npromotional and hyperbole but but the\\nround was already raised you\\'re not\\ndoing that it could be both that\\'s right\\ni actually I I actually think uh you\\nknow in this case it it\\'s true i know\\nthey were pulling you know a lot of\\nthings offline just to support the\\ndemand now the irony is where what was\\nthis demand coming from right and the\\ndemand you know because we didn\\'t\\nmention Gemini 2.5 that happened to\\nrelease uh you know in this last week\\nand part of the reason we didn\\'t mention\\nit is because literally on the day that\\nthey that they launch it open AAI\\nlaunches this upgrade to Imagigen where\\npeople are making all these anime photos\\nof themselves that literally blew up\\nlike demand for a billion anime photos a\\nday from the United States all the way\\nto India uh and they can\\'t support it\\nand some people may say \"Oh well this is\\nan example of how dumb AI is people are\\nusing it to make anime photos.\" But I\\nwould point them to Chris Dixon\\'s you\\nknow blog that he wrote you know some\\ntime ago where where he says \"Listen the\\nnext big thing will first appear as a\\ntoy right and there are a lot of things\\nthat we do for entertainment a lot of\\nthings that you know we know that OpenAI\\nand Chat GBT are being used for a lot of\\ndeep research um but the fact of the\\nmatter is at least it\\'s to this one and\\nI\\'m not going to get into the other you\\nknow valuations for the other models but\\nI\\'d say at least as to this one i was an\\nearly investor in Google i was early\\ninvestor in Meta i saw what those early\\nconsumer products look like what those\\ndemand curves look like what that cohort\\nretention look like and I would just say\\nto you that you know it it what I see\\nout of chat GPT reminds me a lot of kind\\nof those winner take all consumer\\napplications they\\'re not infallible it\\'s\\nnot that they can\\'t be assaulted you\\nknow Grock has been a great model you\\nknow launched by Elon but I think they\\nreally do have a big moat and I think\\nthe network effects are kicking in and I\\nthink that not only are they order of\\nmagnitude bigger but they\\'re also\\ngrowing a lot faster and so you know I\\nthink that the consumer business here\\nwill ultimately be valuable but to your\\npoint the unit economics can be crap\\nalong the way and it\\'s up to the company\\nto launch the things like advertising\\npace uh you know different pricing tiers\\netc that uh you know bring all those\\nthings let me let me ask you a question\\nsince since we you you went down that\\navenue um I think they\\'ve announced um\\nis it 20 million paid users on and 500\\nmillion total users so you have like a\\n4% conversion rate how do you think\\nabout paid versus advertising that\\nconversion rate what is how do you think\\nabout the business model with those\\nfacts on the table yeah I mean honestly\\nI think that right now we probably you\\nknow we\\'re throttling chat GPT so when\\nyou bring on more compute all those\\nnumbers would be higher right if you\\njust have more compute secondly I think\\nmost of Chat GPT users are using a model\\nthat\\'s like a year old right because we\\nhaven\\'t been able to upgrade the they\\nhaven\\'t been able to upgrade the models\\nbecause I don\\'t think they can support\\nthe things they want to do in the\\nupgraded models from a GPU perspective\\num so my suspicion is when they\\'re able\\nto do that that they\\'re going to have a\\nlot more flexibility around things like\\npricing tiers sam has said he doesn\\'t\\nparticularly like advertising but at\\nsome point they will obviously have\\nsomething that they think is beneficial\\nto consumers that will be around that if\\nyou look at operator if I say to\\noperator book me the Four Seasons Hotel\\nin New York next Tuesday and it does\\nthat for me I which I think they\\'re\\ngetting a lot closer to you and I have\\nthis back and forth on that but but but\\nyou know let\\'s just stipulate that even\\nyou believe at some point they\\'re going\\nto get there and if we\\'re driving that\\nkind of value for users either the user\\nwill pay or the end merchant will pay i\\nthink there are all sorts of business\\nmodels that will evolve around that so\\nmy hunch is you\\'re going to see a\\nmixture of advertising you\\'re going to\\nsee a lot of different pricing tiers\\nyou\\'re going to see models i don\\'t think\\nwe\\'re going to have this you know this\\nlong menu of model choices that forces\\nthe consumer to understand the\\ndifference between 04 mini and 03 and 01\\nand you know all these different models\\ni think you\\'re just going to have a\\nsmart model chat GPT5 or or chat GPT6\\nthat may be coming sooner rather than\\nlater that\\'s just going to make those\\nchoices for you and so I think there are\\na lot of way by by the way you know\\nwe\\'ve talked about this in the past but\\nbut I\\'ve I\\'ve often felt that one of the\\nreasons that Google is so susceptible to\\ndisruption is how they\\'ve maximized the\\nrevenue per visitor and I I personally\\ndon\\'t think there\\'s any way when that\\nworld you\\'re talking about that agent\\nworld evolves that that that partner in\\na hotel is going to pay a fee anywhere\\nclose to the to the fee that\\'s paid to\\nGoogle um by someone that\\'s marketing a\\nservice that I always say using LTV math\\nversus transactional math i just don\\'t\\nthink there\\'s any way you can get there\\nand so it that\\'s a huge disruptive\\nadvantage for uh I think it\\'s a huge\\ndisruptive advantage for OpenAI well\\nlet\\'s click on that for a second you\\nknow we have our friend Glenn uh Glenn\\nFogle who runs who runs Booking.com and\\nincredible CEO they\\'ve built an\\nincredible business um you know they\\'re\\none of the largest advertisers\\nhistorically have been one of the\\nlargest advertisers on Google i think\\nit\\'s been reported that Google generates\\nit\\'s one of their largest uh advertising\\ncategories in the world is travel hotels\\nspecifically booking is one of their\\nlargest global advertisers so you sell a\\n$100 hotel room and you take $20 right\\nyoubooking.com let\\'s call take 18 to 20\\nbucks and then you pay a portion of that\\nto Google maybe half of it maybe more\\nthan half of it well actually actually\\nto be fair in in many circumstances you\\nknow they\\'ll be using what I call LTV\\nmath and they\\'ll pay they\\'ll pay more\\nthan 100% oh they\\'ll they\\'ll pay 50\\nbucks instead of 20 because and then\\nthey\\'ll say \"Well if the customer comes\\nback twice in a year we get to break\\neven in the first year and we\\'re going\\nto hold them forever.\" And this is why\\nthat won\\'t work in the agent world which\\nis no one\\'s going to think that way\\nbecause if you\\'re a white label service\\nthat\\'s underneath the the agent model\\nthe most you can share is 10 of the 20\\nright or or whatever you know it\\'s a\\nit\\'s a so so this there there\\'s no doubt\\nthere\\'s competition coming to that um\\nyou know Google\\'s traded down from 200\\nto 150 in change and and you know they\\nsee that disruption coming their way the\\nirony here right is we we still have you\\nknow this antitrust investigation with\\nwith with Google i always I always get a\\nyou know a laugh out of the fact that\\nfinally in 2025 the first time we\\'ve\\nactually had competition for Google like\\nvery clear that competition is coming to\\nall those categories and now we get\\naround to talking about breaking up\\ntheir search monopoly i mean it\\'s\\nridiculous i don\\'t think that\\'s I think\\nthat\\'s the last of our problems but I do\\nthink we\\'re going to see business model\\nevolution around these different\\ncategories so let\\'s just say Bill that\\nit settles out at 10 bucks right that\\nthe hotel hotels are clearly willing to\\ngive 20 bucks let\\'s say it settles out\\nat 10 bucks well hell that\\'s all upside\\nfor Open AI right but it\\'s replacing 50\\nfor Google that\\'s my only point yeah no\\nvery good point by by the way another\\nthing played out in this space a little\\nlittle out of order of our competition\\nbut there\\'s this acronym people are\\nstarting to use MCP that is a way for\\nyou to represent your service like if\\nyou were booking.com to a to a model um\\nso that it\\'s not simply scraping your\\nwebsite which is certainly not the ideal\\nway to do this thing that that standard\\nI believe got started in anthropic but\\nopen AAI has agreed to support it and so\\nanother factor that plays out with\\nwhoever\\'s most aggressive with the open\\nstandards is they might be able to take\\na lead in defining these things which\\ncould be ad advantageous to them and I I\\ngot to tell you you know I I meant to\\nsay this earlier when we were talking\\nabout the open source stuff but I got to\\nbelieve the anxiety\\'s high at Google i\\ngot to believe the anxietyy\\'s high at\\nMeta we\\'ve seen some uh high executive\\nshifts and departures also at Apple in\\nterms of who\\'s in charge of these things\\nand so I see those moves and I think\\nthat must represent anxiety you know\\nthese are there\\'s a lot at stake and so\\nI it\\'ll be really interesting to see how\\nopen people are how willing they are to\\nbe open with their models how aggressive\\nthey are because I think it\\'s a really\\ncritical window i\\'m talking about like\\nnext 3 to 6 months could dictate who\\'s\\nstanding on top of the hill 5 10 years\\nfrom now well the tectonic plates as\\nI\\'ve said as we\\'ve said for now two\\nyears this is the first time they\\'ve\\nshifted in this magnitude in 20 years\\nright this is a 20 20 year event for 20\\nyears the search paradigm ruled\\neverything in consumer internet and\\nGoogle stood at the top of that mountain\\nand it took something you know it took\\nan AI level shift it took chat GPT\\nmoment and them getting to the scale of\\nmaybe a billion monthlies and 500\\nmillion weeklies to even lead to this\\nconversation but things happen very\\nslowly Bill as we know and then they\\nhappen very fast and I think that\\'s your\\npoint yeah before we run out of time we\\nhad an IPO which we haven\\'t had very\\nmany of let\\'s talk IPOs um both core we\\nbut but after that let\\'s just talk about\\nIPOs in general\\nwell it\\'s great you know like uh as you\\nknow um we\\'re shareholders in\\nCororeweave um since a couple rounds ago\\nwe were one of the largest buyers in the\\nIPO and we\\'re happy we did you know um\\nthe you know I have to say on Friday I\\nwas pretty damn nervous bill it broke\\nthe offering price went down to about 37\\nbucks a share i think today they had\\nsome announcements of of this deal with\\nGoogle where they\\'re going to provide\\nNvidia Grace Blackwells through uh\\nthrough Coreweave so Google\\'s going to\\nbe buying a bunch of Nvidia chips\\nthrough Coreweave um and one of the big\\ncriticisms of this company was they were\\ntoo dependent upon Microsoft but now\\nthey\\'ve diversified they have Microsoft\\nMeta now Google OpenAI Nvidia Coher\\nMistral and so I think they\\'ve really\\nyou know emerged as the leading AI kind\\nof cloud and the stock in the last\\ncouple days despite the fact they took\\nit public last Friday i mean talk about\\ntaking a company public into a category\\n5 hurricane i mean we had we had like\\nliberation day staring us in the face\\nand they had to fly into that and you\\nknow as you pointed out it\\'s it it\\nwasn\\'t the least controversial of IPOs\\nbut I have to give credit to Mike uh\\nIntrour and his team and listen I\\'m here\\nin Silicon Valley they started this\\ncompany 5 years ago it\\'s worth over $30\\nbillion today has played a really\\nimportant role in standing up open AI\\nand a lot of the leading AI labs and I\\njust think that\\'s a good thing for all\\nof us but it\\'s not you know it\\'s also\\nfair to ask the questions that you\\'ve\\nasked um you know around you know kind\\nof the durability if you will about\\nabout coreweave and the revenue yeah and\\nlook it it\\'s you\\'re you\\'re absolutely\\nright it\\'s so funny um we sit around and\\ncomplain about the IPO market not being\\nopen and you know for the entirety of\\n2024 the markets were up 30% you know\\nthe sunshine was out and no one was\\ngoing so here someone finally gets the\\nguts to go and the markets of course\\nhave have turned the other way and\\nthat\\'s why man I like anyone that tells\\nyou when you\\'re ready to go public that\\nyou have to wait on the markets to be in\\na particular place i would tell them to\\nshut the up and like like like take\\nyour company out like you can\\'t control\\nthat thing that\\'s an external factor and\\nI also believe a lot of people because\\nof my stance on direct listing said \"Was\\nthis a good IPO a bad IPO?\" I mean as\\nyou said there\\'s stuff moving all over\\nthe place like you have you have a\\nleader in their field unquestionably\\nhuge revenue growth their business model\\nisn\\'t fully unpacked because the capex\\nis invested so far ahead of of the\\nproduct so you can\\'t look at the income\\nstatement and say \"Oh the unit economics\\nare perfect.\" And there\\'s and there\\'s\\nquestions about what is the appropriate\\ndepreciation schedule and all these\\nthings um but but I I am glad that they\\ngot out and I\\'m glad that it\\'s done fine\\nthey\\'ve had basically two customer\\nannouncements since they went out which\\nshows how fast this AI world moves um\\nand I think that\\'s why the stock went\\nfrom 40 to 36 and and way back up above\\nthat now let\\'s hope that it brings more\\nIPOs to the table this company needed\\ncapital um because it\\'s a capital\\nintensive business and and those are the\\nones that tend to you know come to the\\nmarkets eventually no matter what we\\nhave this offsetting reality you know\\nthat the stripes of the world and and\\ndata bricks and others are choosing to\\ndelay being public and have massive\\naccess to private capital and maybe\\nthat\\'s a discussion for another day but\\nthere are a few others clarnas in the\\npipeline you know we\\'ve talked about\\ncerebras being in the pipeline and and\\nso I I\\'m always hopeful i\\'m always kind\\nof\\nuh just wanting for there to be more\\ncompanies that are willing to move into\\nthe public markets but the offset of\\nwhat we talked about at the beginning is\\ngoing to be there and so we\\'ll see how\\nthose things interact with a choppy\\nmarket well yeah you know and somebody\\nelse I should mention is Morgan Stanley\\ni mean they took a lot of heat last\\nFriday you know on this deal why are you\\nbringing it now the you know the stock\\nwent below 40 cnbc was roundly critical\\nof you know of the company you know and\\nof Morgan Stanley and the stocks at 60\\nbucks or whatever it ended today at and\\nso again you know we feel good as\\nshareholders i feel good for the people\\ninvolved in the company obviously there\\nare still questions um you know that\\nremain about the business you mentioned\\ndepreciation the one thing I\\'d tell you\\nabout the depreciation argument as as it\\nas it relates to this company is you\\nknow a lot of people push on you know\\nthere\\'s a statement by Jensen at at GTC\\nthat you know hoppers may not have value\\nbecause Grace Blackwell is so much\\nbetter he was a little more aggressive\\nthan that say it he he called himself\\nthe the chief revenue destroyer and\\nbasically made statements that I think\\nif you interpreted or interpreted\\naccurately would imply that maybe you\\nshould have a\\ntwo-year depreciation not a six like he\\nmade it sound that way it\\'s very abrupt\\nand he took a lot of heat and he\\nprobably wishes he hadn\\'t said it but he\\nsaid it and my my view on this is like\\nlisten because we got to square this\\ncircle we have you know the Sachs tweet\\nyou know we know that inference demand\\nis off the charts everybody has you know\\nis demonstrating their need for more\\nGPUs to run inference everything in the\\nworld is becoming you know inference\\nwe\\'ve talked about that at length and so\\nmy view is this you know like when you\\ntalk about two years for GPUs they\\'re\\ngoing to cutting edge GPUs are going to\\nbe used for cutting edge training for\\nthe you know frontier models in that\\nfirst two-year period but all these\\nthings are going to continue to get used\\nfor inference and the right way to think\\nabout coreweave you know and you know I\\nthink the consensus margins for this\\nbusiness are like 25% EBIT you know over\\nthe course of the next couple years how\\ndo they get there you know so think\\nabout their their unit economics bill\\nyou know their their capex their opex so\\nthey got to they got to get a data\\ncenter they got to pay for all their\\noperating expenses then they got to buy\\nthe servers so the way this works I\\nthink is they sell a four-year deal to\\nMicrosoft or or a four or five year deal\\nto OpenAI or four-year deal to Google or\\nwhatever they expect to pay back all the\\ncapex opex and GPUs in three years and\\nso the fourth year which is a four-year\\nguaranteed contract the fourth year is\\nyour profit margin right and then\\nanything you earn past the four years\\nthat\\'s all gravy on top and the\\nconsensus earnings are not giving them\\nany credit for anything after the end of\\nthose contract periods now what I\\'ll\\ntell you is you know and we\\'ve done a\\nlot of research on this there\\'s still a\\nlot of A100s in use in the world today\\nin fact Jensen has talked at length\\nabout that that\\'s a 2020 product so\\nwe\\'re in the fifth year and A100s are\\nstill out there being used by almost\\neveryone that bought A100s you know and\\nthen if you look at it I think Jensen at\\nGTC said last year that OpenAI had just\\nretired the V100s that was a 2017 GPU so\\nthat\\'s like a 7-year life cycle that\\nthey were using those for and so I I I\\nthink that we have a lot of comfort that\\nat a minimum people are going to be\\nusing these things for four years a\\ncouple years for training a couple years\\nfor inference um I\\'ve yet to hear of\\nanybody throwing away any GPU because it\\ndoesn\\'t have value remember the way CUDA\\nworks the software that runs these GPUs\\nit constantly gets upgraded it\\'s like my\\nTesla right i had an old Tesla Model S\\nlike 7 years old but it felt like a new\\ncar because my software got updated all\\nthe time and so and frankly the the the\\nyou know it still got me to the places I\\nneeded to get to it wasn\\'t as good as\\nthe new model I bought in December with\\nfull FSD and everything else but it\\ndidn\\'t feel like a really old car\\nbecause the software was constantly\\nupdating i kind of think of that the\\nsame way for these GPUs the GPUs are\\ngetting better every year even though\\nthe hardware remains the same so I\\'m not\\nnearly as worried about that\\ndepreciation schedule it seems to be you\\nknow a big hit on the company and lots\\nof people are talking about it but\\nthey\\'re out the door and um you know\\nkudos to them on this big new deal today\\nbut look the the push back on that is\\nobviously that that it\\'s not a zero or\\none like you make it sound like it\\'s\\nbinary you either throw it away or it\\'s\\nsuper valuable and what inevitably\\nhappens is the earning power of that\\nproduct drops over time and so there is\\nI think a reasonable question you know\\nshould it be more of like an accelerated\\ndepreciation schedule the idea with\\ndepreciation is to kind of um you know\\nthey say the useful life so you\\'d kind\\nof want it to mirror the earnability of\\nthe asset over time and so six years\\nstraight probably isn\\'t the best fit for\\nthat but we\\'ll see we\\'ll see what\\nhappens over time you you know their\\npeers the the incumbents in this world\\nwere at four years ago and pushed it to\\nsix which wasn\\'t\\nuh that the answer may the answer may\\nlie somewhere in between and you know\\nlike I said I don\\'t think they need it\\nto be more than four\\nin order to achieve the the the the\\nmargins that they have but they\\'re also\\nto your point it\\'s a highly levered\\nbusiness they got to delever the\\nbusiness so there\\'s a lot of things in\\nplay here with Core Weave that\\'s why\\nagain if you look at the the multiples\\nit\\'s trading at well I don\\'t know what\\nthey are today but the the multiples\\nthat came public at were not overly\\ntaxing from our perspective but there\\'s\\na lot of headwind for all these AI\\ncompanies i mean you have Nvidia trading\\nat 19 times fully taxed earnings and so\\nyou know there\\'s a lot of skepticism in\\nthe world notwithstanding all the stuff\\nwe hear about demand a lot of skepticism\\nin the world about uh AI demand a riddle\\nfor you before we move on yes what do\\nSalesforce Netflix Square Amazon Palo\\nAlto Networks Facebook Snap Proof Point\\nNetswuite and Coree have in common\\nno idea they all broke issue oh wow and\\nso wow when the talking heads on CNBC\\nand others are critical of a company\\nbecause they trade below their IPO price\\nit\\'s just such a wrong way to look at\\nthings and um you know it I think one of\\nthe reasons those highquality companies\\nget priced to perfection is the founders\\nare stronger minded and have more\\nleverage and negotiate more on this\\nagreed upon price which would also go\\naway with a direct listing but boy what\\na silly way to think about uh quality uh\\nwhether or not whether or not you give\\naway more and pop that\\'s what a lot of\\npeople think you know i don\\'t think you\\nknow well I I kind of thought that maybe\\nyou thought this was a perfect IPO\\nbecause it ended day one at precisely 40\\nbucks which was the offer engineered\\nlet\\'s be realistic you also you also\\nthere there\\'s some peculiar terms in\\nthis company that you may have played a\\npart in it uh the series C has a put\\nright at like\\n3875 no doubt in my mind people wanted\\nto make sure it priced above that which\\nmay have played a factor here who knows\\num but but let\\'s move on let\\'s talk\\nabout one more thing before we go so\\nmuch news in one week um the uh the Tik\\nTok thing there\\'s new information as we\\nspeak tell me what you know well I mean\\nlisten there\\'s a lot of rumors swirling\\nwhich not surprisingly this deal is you\\nknow set to expire or need to be\\nextended by April 5th under the terms of\\nof the first congressional extension\\nthat that that was made by Trump they\\nyou know they\\'ve made very clear that\\nyou know there are a lot of buyers for\\nthe Tik Tok asset um bill and that the\\npresident has wants to put together a\\ndeal and and and of course we have all\\nthese tariffs going on on China and so\\nI\\'m sure this will end up as part of a\\nbig trade negotiation as it pertains to\\nChina but as you know just for everybody\\nyou know we\\'re shareholders i\\'ve been a\\nshareholder in this company since 2015\\none of the earliest venture capital\\nrounds in bite dance the parent company\\nwhich you know which owns Tik Tok you\\nknow and for the last two years I\\'ve\\nagreed largely with Elon and Sachs and\\nothers that we should engage with China\\nwe shouldn\\'t just shut down Tik Tok we\\nwe should make Tik Tok abide by the\\nrules and regulations right that we have\\nin this country and and and that\\'s what\\nthis whole legislative unwind was about\\nyou know the for sale of spin out Tik\\nTok US so here\\'s what I\\'m hearing i\\'m\\nhearing that there will be a new company\\nstood up you know and I\\'m not privy to\\nany information i\\'m not party to to\\nthese negotiations but I\\'m hear you know\\nt let\\'s call it Tik Tok US and that Tik\\nTok US will be partly owned by bite\\ndance but I think they have to keep that\\nowner ownership threshold under 20% so\\nlet\\'s call it 19.5% owned by bite dance\\nthat it will be owned partially by just\\nthe existing shareholders remember the\\nshareholders in bite dance 60% of those\\nare US investors like alttimeter so that\\nwe\\'ll get our shares in bite dance or in\\ntik tok US and then 50% of it or\\nthereabouts will be new investors so\\nthink folks like some of the rumors I\\'ve\\ns I\\'ve seen Amazon Andre\\nuh Oracle you know etc and these are\\ninvestors who are not currently in the\\ncap table of of bite dance so uh\\nAltimeter CO2 we\\'re currently in the cap\\ntable of bite dance so we\\'re not going\\nto be part of the new investor syndicate\\nor at least that\\'s my\\nunderstanding so So imagine they stand\\nthat up and then the question and where\\nwould that where would that money go\\nBrad so the money would go into this new\\nco right so the new co would be\\ncapitalized with this new money it\\nwould so it\\' be new fresh capital for\\nnew co it wouldn\\'t go to bite dance no\\nthat\\'s my understanding that it would go\\ninto new co that new co would get a\\nlicense to the algorithm and it would be\\nup to new co to audit that to audit the\\ndata because remember that\\'s the whole\\npoint here bill like we want to have\\nsome control over you you know the\\nalgorithm in the data so it makes sense\\nthat Oracle would be involved in that\\nbecause remember Tik Tok runs on the\\nOracle cloud uh down in Texas i think a\\nlogical question is okay like what\\'s the\\nbig what\\'s the so what here and I\\'m\\nhearing that the valuation for Tik Tok\\nUS could be pretty low which I would\\nexpect right um because remember the you\\nknow uh Trump has said maybe we\\'ll put\\nthis in the US sovereign wealth fund so\\nhe\\'s negotiating the deal i expect that\\nhe wants to get a pretty damn mention\\nthat you didn\\'t mention what percentage\\nwas for that but is that part of the cap\\ntable too no no no idea no idea yeah one\\none particular question if you go back\\nsix months maybe three or six months\\nthere was a lot of discussion that I\\nwould suggest that that the parent\\ncompany Bite Dance had no interest in\\nthis deal they\\'d rather shut it down\\nthan do this have they changed their\\nmind for some reason is there new a new\\nperspective from their side well I think\\nremember if we go back 6\\nmonths there was a camp that said shut\\nit down and there\\'s a camp say saying or\\nwe\\'ll just take it right right and like\\nI think that the company\\'s perspective\\nYaming the founder of the company he\\nbasically said there\\'s no way to\\nseparate the algorithm between Tik Tok\\nUS and Tik Tok rest the world because\\ncreators in the US create content that\\ngo to the rest of the world and vice\\nversa and so like if you took away all\\nthe US it does so much damage he would\\nyou would be better to shut down Tik Tok\\nUS and just have invite the US creators\\nonto the French platform or the the the\\nUnited Kingdom version of this or the\\nAustralian version of this via a VPN or\\nsomething so I think the big change here\\nBill is this idea that US Tik Tok um and\\nglobal Tik Tok will continue to use the\\nsame algorithm and it\\'s just a license\\nto the US Tik Tok would be my guess was\\npart of that bridge or breakthrough i\\nthink a key thing here is like how does\\nalttimeter or sequoia or other US\\ninvestors remember 60% of the investors\\nin bite dance are US investors and th\\nthe investors in places like alimter\\nthey\\'re pension funds they\\'re teachers\\nthey\\'re firefighters and if you think\\nabout the fair value for bite dance I\\nthink most people although it only\\ntrades at let\\'s call it 300 billion most\\npeople think the fair value of this is\\ncloser to a trillion dollars are\\ncertainly to 800 billion so if you take\\n60% of a trillion dollars that\\'s 600\\nbillion in locked up venture capital\\nvalue for all of the endowments and\\npension funds etc for US investors\\nthat\\'s more than almost every other\\nunrealized venture gain put together\\nBill right and so if you\\'re able to take\\nthis company public that turns into DPI\\nlike hundreds of billions of dollars of\\nDPI that goes out to the investors in\\nthese venture funds this company being\\nTik Tok or or or Bite Dance when you\\nthis company being bite dance but we had\\nto get the Tik Tok deal done as a\\ncondition required to get bite dance\\npublic or bite dance out the door and so\\nremember bite dance about 90% of bite\\ndance\\'s business is not Tik Tok US 90%\\nof the value of the company is things\\nlike doyan which is the Chinese version\\nof Tik Tok and Daoba which is the\\nChinese version of chat GPT and Tik Tok\\naround the world and so there\\'s a huge\\nand profitable business inside of China\\nand in rest of world and we\\'re just\\ndebating this piece in the United States\\nand so as a shareholder I will tell you\\nthat whatever the delilution is caused\\nby this it\\'s nominal relative to the\\nvalue of the total and what I really\\nwant to see get done is just certainty\\nright certainty for the company i think\\nit\\'s good for the US that Tik Tok will\\nremain my kids love it and I don\\'t you\\nknow I I I\\'m glad we\\'re going to make\\nhim abide by the rules and regulation i\\nthink it\\'s a win uh you know for for for\\nteam Trump i think it\\'s a win for Bite\\nDance but remember now we just hit him\\ntoday Bill with 54% tariffs okay so\\nthere may be a conversation that has to\\noccur before she and Trump i thought\\nthis deal would get approved by China\\nnow I\\'m not so sure so and and the\\nChinese government could probably block\\nthe deal so exactly so just because we\\nannounce a deal if we do hear a deal\\nannounced over the course of the next\\nfew days or over the next week doesn\\'t\\nmean that it\\'s a done deal but I I\\'ll\\nleave on an optimistic note okay let\\'s\\ndo that i think that the president wants\\nto do a deal with shei um I don\\'t\\nbelieve we\\'re going to have 54% tariffs\\nagainst China um we have too it\\'s too\\nimportant um to the rest of the world uh\\nthat we can cooperate with China and\\nthings like ending the war in the\\nUkraine things in the Middle East yes\\nthey are a uh uh uh you know there is a\\ngreat competitive struggle between the\\ntwo uh countries but I think that\\nultimately um you know the president\\nwill cut a deal he said that he likes\\nshe invited him to the inauguration and\\nas we know he\\'s a dealmaker and now we\\ngot the everything from the Panama Canal\\nto negotiate over to you know Tik Tok to\\nall the other trade deals between the\\ntwo countries um so I suspect that that\\nwhen we get back to all what what really\\ncame out of liberation day and what\\nreally matters I think the most\\nimportant thing that matters is USChina\\nbilateral trade relations and um I think\\nthat\\'s going to that\\'s going to really\\ndictate um the direction of global\\ngrowth and the direction of US and China\\neconomic growth over the course of the\\nnext few years important to watch all\\nright man take care great seeing you\\nhave fun at the games take care\\n[Music]\\nas a reminder to everybody just our\\nopinions not investment advice this',
